## Domain name rules

Unfortunately, there isn't clear consensus on what is allowed in a subdomain vs a top level domain (TLD); referred to collectively as 'domain labels'. So, here are the rules we follow:

* Domain labels may no more than 63 bytes in length.
* Labels are composed of alpha-numeric characters (a-z, 0-9, and any non-ASCII Unicode character) and hyphens ('-'), except:
  * the label may not begin or end with a hyphen,
  * may not consist of a single digit,
  * the label must not have consecutive hyphens in the 3rd and 4th position. E.g. 'xy--z' is invalid.[^1]
* TLDs must be at least two bytes (two ASCII characters or a single Unicode character) and may not be composed only of digits.
* A fully qualified domain is limited to 255 bytes in total.

[^1]: The DNS protocol only allows a-z, 0-9, and '-' in domain labels. International domains are encoded as special 'xn--' domains. E.g., 'कॉम"' is encoded as 'xn--11b4c3d'. This is why hyphens in the third and fourth position are restricted. So, while 'xn--11b4c3d' is a valid domain, you can't register such domains directly. You would register the international domain and it's translated to an 'xn--' domain in the background.
